This application uses [Spring Security](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security) with [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org) in a "single page application" where the UI and resource servers are separate, and secured using a shared token store implemented with [Spring Session](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/).

It is one of a pair of samples from an article and both are described in more detail [here](https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/vanilla/README.md).
